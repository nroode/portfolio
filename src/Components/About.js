                    Hi, I'm Natalie Roode. I'm a front-end developer who believes in beautiful and functional design and optimizing user experiences.
                    I'm a market researcher turned web developer. I'm experienced at helping clients better understand their consumers, consulting on business decisions, and managing complex research projects from design through analysis.
                    I always enjoyed the more technical and creative aspects of my work - working closely with programmers in implementing online surveys and processing data, and creating reports that told a data-driven story through clear and compelling visuals.
                    I decided to take the plunge into web development after realizing it was the intersection of the skills I loved utilizing most - problem solving, the ability to create, and user-centered design. My interests in psychology continue to impact my perspective as a web developer as I aim to produce beautiful web sites with intuitive user experiences.
